R data types
===

So far we've been manipulating data frames, making visuals, and summarizing. This got you pretty far! Now we get more in the weeds of programming. Today is all about types of data in R.


Vectors
===
type: section


A data frame is really a **list** of **vectors**, where each vector is a column of the same length (number of rows). But data frames are not the only object we want to have in R, e.g. linear regression output. We need to learn about vectors, matrices, and lists to do additional things we can't express with `dplyr` syntax.


Making vectors
===
incremental: true

In R, we call a set of values a **vector**. We can create vectors by using the `c` function ("c" for **c**ombine or **c**oncatenate).

```{r}
c(1, 3, 7, -0.5)
```

Vectors have **length**:
```{r}
length(c(1, 3, 7, -0.5))
```


Element-wise vector math
===
incremental: true

When doing arithmetic operations on vectors, R handles these element-wise:
```{r}
c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)
c(1, 2, 3, 4)^3 # exponentiation with ^
```

Common operations: `*`, `/`, `exp` = $e^x$, `log` = $\log_e(x)$


Vector recycling
===
incremental: true

If we work with vectors of different lengths, R will **recycle** the shorter one by repeating it to make it match up with the longer one:
```{r}
c(0.5, 3) * c(1, 2, 3, 4)
c(0.5, 3, 0.5, 3) * c(1, 2, 3, 4) # same thing
```


Scalars as recycling
===
incremental: true

A special case of recycling involves arithmetic with **scalars** (a single number). These are vectors of length 1 that are recycled to make a longer vector:
```{r}
3 * c(-1, 0, 1, 2) + 1
```


Warning on recycling
===
incremental: true

Recycling doesn't work so well with vectors of incommensurate lengths:
```{r, warning=TRUE}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5)
```
Try not to let R's recycling behavior catch you by surprise!


Vector-wise math
===
incremental: true

Some functions operate on an entire vector and return one number rather than working element-wise:
```{r}
sum(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
max(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
```

Some others: `min`, `mean`, `median`, `sd`, `var` -- you've seen these used with `dplyr::summarize`.


Example: standardizing data
===
incremental: true

Let's say we had some test scores and we wanted to put these on a standardized scale: $$z_i = \frac{x_i - \text{mean}(x)}{\text{SD}(x)}$$
```{r}
x <- c(97, 68, 75, 77, 69, 81, 80, 92, 50, 34, 66, 83, 62)
z <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
round(z,2)
```
See also: `scale`


Types of vectors
===
incremental: true

`class` or `str` will tell you what kind of vector you have. There are a few common types of vectors:

- **numeric**: `c(1, 10*3, 4, -3.14)`
    + **integer**: `0:10`
- **character**: `c("red", "blue", "yellow", "blue")`
- **factor**: `factor(c("red", "blue", "yellow", "blue"))`
- **logical**: `c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)`


Generating numeric vectors
===
incremental: true

There are shortcuts for generating common kinds of vectors:
```{r}
seq(-3, 6, by = 1.75)
rep(c(-1, 0, 1), times = 3)
rep(c(-1, 0, 1), each = 3)
```


Generating integer vectors
===
incremental: true

We can get a special case of numeric vectors using the `:` shortcut:
```{r}
n <- 12
1:n
n:4
```


Character vectors
===
incremental: true

Character vectors come up when dealing with data like names, addresses, and IDs:
```{r}
first_names <- c("Andre", "Beth", "Carly", "Dan")
class(first_names)
```


Factor vectors
===
incremental: true

Factors encode a (modest) number of **levels**, like for gender, experimental group, or geographic region: 
```{r}
gender <- factor(c("M", "F", "F", "M"))
gender
```
Character data usually can't go directly into a statistical model, but factor data can. It has an underlying numeric representation:
```{r}
as.numeric(gender)
```


Logical vectors
===
incremental: true

We make logical vectors by defining binary conditions to check for. For example, we can look at which of the first names has at least 4 letters:
```{r}
name_lengths <- nchar(first_names) # number of characters
name_lengths
name_lengths >= 4
```


Logical vectors as numeric
===
incremental: true

You can do math with logical vectors, because `TRUE`=1 and `FALSE`=0:
```{r}
name_lengths >= 4
mean(name_lengths >= 4)
```

What did this last line do?


Combining logical conditions
===
incremental: true

Suppose we are interested in which names have an even number of letters or whose second letter is "a":
```{r}
even_length <- (name_lengths %% 2 == 0)
# %% is modulo operator: gives remainder when dividing
even_length
second_letter_a <- (substr(first_names, start=2, stop=2) == "a")
# substr: substring (portion) of a char vector
second_letter_a
```


Logical operators: previously seen in dplyr::filter
===
incremental: true

* `&` is **AND** (both conditions must be `TRUE` to be `TRUE`):
```{r}
even_length & second_letter_a
```
* `|` is **OR** (at least one condition must be `TRUE` to be `TRUE`):
```{r}
even_length | second_letter_a
```
* `!` is **NOT** (switches `TRUE` and `FALSE`):
```{r}
!(even_length | second_letter_a)
```


Subsetting vectors
===
incremental: true

We can **subset** the vector in a number of ways:

* Passing a single index or vector of entries to keep:
```{r}
first_names[c(1, 4)]
```
* Passing a single index or vector of entries to drop:
```{r}
first_names[-c(1, 4)]
```


Subsetting vectors
===
incremental: true

* Passing a logical vector (`TRUE`=keep, `FALSE`=drop):
```{r}
first_names[even_length | second_letter_a]
first_names[gender != "F"] # != is "not equal"
```


More logical/subsetting functions
===
incremental: true

`%in%` lets you avoid typing a lot of logical ORs (`|`):
```{r}
first_names %in% c("Andre", "Carly", "Dan")
```

`which` gives the indices of `TRUE`s in a logical vector:
```{r}
which(first_names %in% c("Andre", "Carly", "Dan"))
```


Missing values
===
incremental: true

Missing values are coded as `NA` entries without quotes:
```{r}
vector_w_missing <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6, NA)
```

Even one `NA` "poisons the well": you'll get NA out of your calculations unless you remove them manually or with the extra argument `na.rm = TRUE` (in some functions):
```{r}
mean(vector_w_missing)
mean(vector_w_missing, na.rm=TRUE)
```


Finding missing values
===
incremental: true

**WARNING:** you can't test for missing values by seeing if they "equal" (`==`) `NA`:
```{r}
vector_w_missing == NA
```

But you can use the `is.na` function:
```{r}
is.na(vector_w_missing)
mean(vector_w_missing[!is.na(vector_w_missing)])
```


Inf and NaN
===
incremental: true

Sometimes we might get positive or negative infinity ($\pm \infty$) or `NaN` (**N**ot **A** **N**umber) from our calculations:
```{r}
c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) / 0
```
You can check for these using functions like `is.finite` or `is.nan`.
```{r}
is.finite(c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) / 0)
is.nan(c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) / 0)
```


Previewing vectors
===
incremental: true

Like with data frames, we can use `head` and `tail` to preview vectors:
```{r}
head(letters) # letters is a built-in vector
head(letters, 10)
tail(letters)
```


Named vector entries
===
incremental: true

We can also index vectors by assigning **names** to the entries.
```{r}
a_vector <- 1:26
names(a_vector) <- LETTERS # capital version of letters
head(a_vector)
a_vector[c("R", "S", "T", "U", "D", "I", "O")]
```

Names are nice for subsetting because they don't depend on your data being in a certain order.


Matrices
===
type: section


Matrices: 2D vectors
===
incremental: true

**Matrices** extend vectors to two dimensions: rows and columns.
```{r}
(a_matrix <- matrix(letters[1:6], nrow=2, ncol=3))
(b_matrix <- matrix(letters[1:6], nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))
```


Binding vectors
===
incremental: true

We can also make matrices by binding vectors together.
```{r}
(c_matrix <- cbind(c(1, 2), c(3, 4), c(5, 6)))
(d_matrix <- rbind(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)))
```


Subsetting matrices
===
incremental: true

We subset matrices using the same methods as with vectors, except we refer to `[rows, columns]`:
```{r}
a_matrix[1, 2] # row 1, column 2
a_matrix[1, c(2, 3)] # row 1, columns 2 and 3
```


Matrices becoming vectors
===
incremental: true

If a matrix ends up having just one row or column after subsetting, by default R will make it into a vector. You can prevent this behavior using `drop=FALSE`.

```{r}
a_matrix[, 1] # all rows, column 1, becomes a vector
a_matrix[, 1, drop=FALSE] # all rows, column 1, stays a matrix
```


Matrix data type warning
===
incremental: true

Matrices can be numeric, integer, factor, character, or logical, just like vectors. Also like vectors, they must be all the same data type.
```{r}
(bad_matrix <- cbind(1:2, letters[1:2]))
class(bad_matrix)
```
In this case, everything was converted to character so as not to lose information.


Matrix dimension names
===
incremental: true

We can access dimension names or name them ourselves:
```{r}
rownames(bad_matrix) <- c("Harry", "Draco")
colnames(bad_matrix) <- c("Potions grade", "Quidditch position")
bad_matrix
bad_matrix["Draco", , drop=FALSE]
```


Matrix arithmetic
===
incremental: true

Matrices of the same dimensions can have math performed entry-wise with the usual arithmetic operators:


```{r}
cbind(c_matrix, d_matrix) # look at side by side
3 * c_matrix / d_matrix
```


Matrix transposition and multiplication
===
incremental: true

To do matrix transpositions, use `t()`.
```{r}
(e_matrix <- t(c_matrix))
```

To do proper matrix multiplication (not entry-wise), use `%*%`.

```{r}
(f_matrix <- d_matrix %*% e_matrix)
```

Matrix inversion
===
incremental: true

To invert an invertible square matrix, use `solve()`.

```{r}
(g_matrix <- solve(f_matrix))
f_matrix %*% g_matrix
```

Diagonal matrices
===
incremental: true

To extract the diagonal of a matrix or make a diagonal matrix (usually the identity matrix), use `diag()`.

```{r}
diag(2)
diag(g_matrix)
```


Lists
===
type: section


What are lists?
===
incremental: true

**Lists** are an object that can store multiple types of data.
```{r}
(my_list <- list("first_thing" = 1:5, "second_thing" = matrix(8:11, nrow = 2), "third_thing" = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)))
```


Accessing list elements
===
incremental: true

You can access a list element by its name or number in `[[]]`, or a `$` with its name:
```{r}
my_list[["first_thing"]]
my_list$first_thing
my_list[[1]]
```

Why two brackets [[]]?
===
incremental: true

```{r}
str(my_list[1])
str(my_list[[1]])
```

If you use one bracket to access list elements, you get a **sublist** back. The double brackets get the actual element in that location in the list.


Sublists can be of length > 1
===
incremental: true

You can use vector-style subsetting to get a sublist:
```{r}
length(my_list[c(1, 2)])
str(my_list[c(1, 2)])
```


Linear regression output is a list!
===
incremental: true

```{r}
str(my_list[[3]])
```

Use names to find out list elements
===
incremental: true

```{r}
names(my_list[[3]])
```


Getting fitted regression coefficients
===
incremental: true

```{r}
my_list[[3]][["coefficients"]]
(speed_beta <- my_list[[3]][["coefficients"]]["speed"])
```

Summarizing regression with a list
===
incremental: true

`summary(lm_object)` is also a list with more information, which has the side effect of printing some output to the console:
```{r}
summary(my_list[[3]]) # this prints output
```


Getting standard errors
===
incremental: true

```{r}
summary(my_list[[3]])[["coefficients"]] # a matrix
(speed_SE <- summary(my_list[[3]])[["coefficients"]]["speed", "Std. Error"])
```


Example: approximate 95% confidence interval
===

```{r}
speed_CI <- speed_beta + c(-qnorm(0.975), qnorm(0.975)) * speed_SE
names(speed_CI) <- c("lower", "upper")
```

Now you can include these values in a Markdown document:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
A 1 mph increase in speed is associated with a `r round(speed_beta, 1)` ft increase in stopping distance (95% CI: (`r round(speed_CI["lower"],1)`, `r round(speed_CI["upper"],1)`)).
```

A 1 mph increase in speed is associated with a `r round(speed_beta, 1)` ft increase in stopping distance (95% CI: (`r round(speed_CI["lower"],1)`, `r round(speed_CI["upper"],1)`)).


Data frames are just a list of vectors!
===
incremental: true

```{r}
str(cars)
length(cars)
length(cars$dist) # should be same as nrow(cars)
```


We can edit cars
===
incremental: true

```{r}
cars2 <- cars
cars2[1, ]
cars2[1, ] <- c(999, 888)
head(cars2, 3)
```

Lab and homework
===
type: section

Suggested lab practice: swirl
===

You can do interactive R tutorials in `swirl` that cover these structure basics. To set up `swirl`:

1. `install.packages("swirl")`
2. `library("swirl")`
3. `swirl()`
4. Choose `R Programming`, pick a tutorial, and follow directions
5. To get out of `swirl`, type `bye()` in the middle of a lesson, or `0` in the menus

At this point, tutorials 1-8 are appropriate.

Homework
===
type:section

For homework, you'll be filling in a template R Markdown file that will walk you through performing multiple linear regression "by hand" and comparing it with what you get using `lm()`. It will involve simulating data (which I will do for you), matrix math, column and row names, accessing list elements.
